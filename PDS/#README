     -------- ---- ------- ---------- ---- ----

These are suggested solutions to the practice problems
referenced in the book:

"The REXX Language on TSO"  by Gabriel F. Gargiulo.
ISBN-10: 1479104779 ISBN-13: 978-1479104772

The members in this PDS are REXX programs, functions
or subroutines.

Note that there is not a program for every problem.
In other words, the numbers for the programs are not consecutive.

The descriptions of the problems and their solutions

 Summary of information:

  Learn how to write programs in the REXX language for TSO, MVS,
  OS/390, Z/OS.

 My first book on the REXX programming language, is out of print.
 This is my second book on REXX for TSO.

 It improves on REXX in the TSO Environment in every way: it
 clarifies important points, it is better organized, and gives
 better examples.

 There are very few other books in print about REXX in the TSO
 Environment.

 This book quickly gets you started writing programs in REXX for
 MVS, OS/390, z/OS.  It covers all REXX language elements, all TSO
 built-in functions, and the more important built-in functions.

 Several REXX programs, macros, and user-written functions are
 illustrated and explained.
