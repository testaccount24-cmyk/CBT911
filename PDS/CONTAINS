/* REXX CONTAINS
A REXX internal function that tells you if the first argument
is contained in the second.

If you wish to use it as an external function
 you need to delete the instruction:
CONTAINS: PROCEDURE

It is executed this way, as an example: (in another program!)
Haystack = "Hello!"
Needle = "!"
If contains(needle,haystack) = 1 then say "OK"
else say "Must contain exclamation (!) character"

say contains("cat","reallocate") gives 1
say contains("cat","kate")       gives 0
say contains("cat")              gives -1
*/
CONTAINS: PROCEDURE


if arg()              < 2 then return -1   /* 2 args required */
if pos(arg(1),arg(2)) > 0 then return 1
return 0
